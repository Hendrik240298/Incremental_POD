# Incremental Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (iPOD) and its application to reduced order modeling (ROM)
## Hendrik Fischer, Julian Roth (2023)

This repository contains a straightforward prototype implementation of the incremental POD (trimmed version of the incremental truncated SVD) to demonstrate its use in reduced order modeling.

## iPOD


## iPOD for snapshot compression



## iPOD for reduced order modeling

### Executing the code
The easiest way to run this Jupyter Notebook is to use Google Colab. To open the notebook in Google Colab you can click on the ".ipynb" file and replace the word 'github' in the url with 'githubtocolab' or you can click on [this link](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Hendrik240298/Incremental_POD/blob/main/iPOD_ROM.ipynb).
